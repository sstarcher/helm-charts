[Helm](https://helm.sh) repo index for my charts as the [primary charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts) repo now prefers charts to be distributed.

Add the repo via:
```console
$ helm repo add sstarcher https://shanestarcher.com/helm-charts/
```

The charts repos can be found outside of this index by going to
